Chris: The Teen Scripter of Roblox Nation 

I'm Chris, a young boy under 18 year old Lua scripter from the Philippines. I learned scripting in just 2 yearsâ€”starting from modded games to creating full custom GUIs and exploits, all on mobile! 

I'm a big fan of RedzHub, and using RedzLib inspired me to start scripting. 
Am i genius? not really Just a lazy guy who always at home

I help others on Scriptblox, dominate Dead Rails, and I'm already planning my future as a Special Forces operator while still enjoying the world of scripting.
