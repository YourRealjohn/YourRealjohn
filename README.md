Chris: The Teen Scripter of Roblox Nation ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­

I'm Chris, a 13-year-old Lua scripter from the Philippines. I learned scripting in just 2 years, starting from modded games to making full custom GUIs and exploitsâ€”on mobile! ðŸ’»ðŸ“±

I use RedzLib because I'm a big fan Redzhub this is also in courage me to make script. I keep my scripts clean, short, and always say: "No prints, full script only." ðŸ”¥

I'm helping others in Scriptblox, dominating Dead Rails, and already planning my future as a Special Forces while still enjoying scripting.

I'm not just making scriptsâ€”I'm building a legacy.
