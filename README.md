Chris: The Teen Scripter of Roblox Nation ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­

I'm Chris, a 13-year-old Lua scripter from the Philippines. I learned scripting in just 2 yearsâ€”starting from modded games to creating full custom GUIs and exploits, all on mobile! ðŸ’»ðŸ“±

I'm a big fan of RedzHub, and using RedzLib inspired me to start scripting. I speak multiple languages:

Japanese â€” because I'm a big fan of anime and learned it slowly by watching a lot of shows

English â€” so I can communicate with players around the world in Roblox

Tagalog â€” it's my native language

Bahasa Indonesia â€” many of my friends are from Indonesia, and some arenâ€™t fluent in English. I also play on Asia servers, so I meet a lot of Indo players


I help others on Scriptblox, dominate Dead Rails, and I'm already planning my future as a Special Forces operatorâ€”while still enjoying the world of scripting. 

I'm not just making scriptsâ€”I'm building a legacy.
